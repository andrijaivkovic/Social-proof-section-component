## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I refined my skills in CSS (Flexbox mainly) and Semantic HTML

### Continued development

I want to focus on learning CSS Grid and using it more. This project could've been done with using a combination of Grid and Flexbox which would've made it easier but I opted for pure Flexbox because I'm more skilled in using Flexbox than Grid.
